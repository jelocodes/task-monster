# Project Task Monster

## The Idea:

A fun side project combining the functionality of a productivity app, with the fun of a virtual pet.

## How it (will eventually) works: 

You can type in tasks in a form to add them to a To-Do Check List. A monster lives on the screen and has an XP (Experience Points) bar. The XP bar fills for each task completed on your To-dD list. Delete a task by dragging it to, and feeding it to the monster. Complete all of the tasks on your list and the monster gains enough XP to level up.

## Still To-Do:

- Make it prettier
- Add way to edit text on tasks
- Refactor code (chunk repeated JS logic into helper functions, etc.)
